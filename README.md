#Build a website that displays the data below in a meaningful and interactive way.

##Domain
* Equipment is a list of equipment that the company owns.
* MaintenanceWorks is a list of maintenance records for each of the the pieces of equipment in the equipment table.  Maintenance on equipment is done on a ad-hoc basis, and the date and time and description of the works at included.  Also included is a time taken for the maintenance to be completed (in minutes).

##Requirements
* A user must be able to add / remove / update data
* ~~The final web application must be available on the internet publically~~
* The current project code MUST be cloned (be aware that forking could let every other visitor here see your progress) 
* There must be evidence of automated (unit or integration) testing techniques used.
* Commit history must be intact.  No one commit repositories please (we want to see how it develops over time)
* Use the data supplied in this repository.  

##Guidelines:
* Should look "nice".  Doesn't need to be a design masterpiece, but should be pleasant to look at.  
* Server side language is open (if it is required)
* Feel free to edit the data, as long as it doesn't become removed from the equipment works register idea.
* A single page style client side javascript app is recommended
* Any questions, raise an issue here
* Having a go and not meeting all requirements is better than not trying.


##Bonus
* Responsive on small / medium and large screen size (responsive design)
* Using test first (TDD) to guide the development 

##Other things of note
* If you are worried about remaining anonymous, create a dummy github or bitbucket account.
* When you are completed, email us back with your repository location (and web address of the site).  This will be kept private.  If your github / bitbucket email address is not the same as you application email, let me know so I can match your submission to your job application.
* Just have a go.
